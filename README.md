## Arabic Keyboard
This is an Arabic keyboard which looks good, functions well and not bloated with ads. Click on the green badge above.

### Features
* Text area auto resizes. No unneeded whitespace. No ads.
* High quality PNG images used instead of CSS for the letters to have maximum compatibility.
* Once the keyboard reaches the bottom, page is auto scrolled to keep it there.
* You can type or click or use both.
* Click animation on keypresses as well.
* Sound option for people who are new to the Arabic language and would like to hear as they type.
* Caps lock is particularly useful for typing with diacritics(tashkeel تَشْكِيل). Type without them first. Turn Caps lock on and go over them again for adding diacritics.
